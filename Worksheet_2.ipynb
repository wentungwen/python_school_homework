Other such common functions are `str()`, `float()`, `int()`, and `input()`. A function is basically just a self-contained bit of code that does something. We have also discussed functions during the lecture. They can be a nice way of compartmentalizing different bits of code, but they are not going to play a big role during this course. You can recognize a function by the parentheses `()`; anything inside the parentheses is an argument, or input, to the function."

    "**[Exercise 4]** According to astrology, some zodiac signs match more with your zodiac sign than others. You have found a Python dictionary that rates your chances of relationship success with every zodiac sign on a scale of 1-10. You write a script that takes a zodiac sign as input (look up the `input()` function for this; you can assume that input is always a key in the dictionary). The script has three possible outcomes based on what you give as input:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the zodiac sign's success chance is equal to or less than 5, have the script print `Unfortunately, this is not going to work out.` as output.\n",
    "- If the zodiac sign's success chance is more than 5 and equal or less than 7, have the script print `It is not certain, but there is potential here.` as output.\n",
    "- If the zodiac sign's success chance is more than 7, have the script print `This may be your soulmate.` as output.\n",

Meaning that you become more successful, the more people you date. That's why you write an \"improved\" version of the astrology check that sums scores. More specifically, it should do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the user enters a zodiac sign, the program prints the match score and the sum of all zodiac signs you have entered into the program. It then asks the user again to enter a zodiac sign.\n",
