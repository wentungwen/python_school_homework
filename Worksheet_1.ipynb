Run the code, and see how it displays your own text.

    "Before we continue with the material, I want to give some information that will hopefully get you in the right mindset if you are unfamiliar with programming. The programming course is really like no other course you have seen in Communication and Information Sciences. The way you learn how to program is by failing a bunch of times until the code finally does what you want it to do. So don't get discouraged when things do not work! When the output is \"wrong\" or you get an error, it does not mean you are bad at programming, it just means that you are working towards the right answer. :) What is very typical is that you work for ages on one of the more challenging exercises, and then when you finally get the right anwer, you think \"Ah jeez, all that work and it was just a few lines of code.\" That's totally normal and part of the process of learning how to program! As I said in the lecture: it is all a puzzle and puzzles are fun. The most important skill when you work on a challenging exercise is to not feel overwhelmed by it, but rather try to break the exercise down into its core components. When you know the steps that you need to undertake to finish an exercise, the hardest part is over. Also important to note: Google is your friend! Functions are explained in more detail on the Python website, and the website [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) probably has the answer to all of your issues (well, not \\*all\\* of your issues, but you know what I mean). So if you add `site:stackoverflow.com` to your Google query, you should be able to find someone who was experiencing a similar issue, and the way to solve it. Figuring out the best way to Google your issues is an important programming (and life) skill."

Too heavy.\"` or `\"[x] bananas weigh [bananas] total. I can carry this.\"` Where `x` and `bananas` correspond with the values of the variables `x` and `bananas`. So if you change the value of `x`, the output of `x` and `bananas` should change as well. Hint: look up how you can change data types."
