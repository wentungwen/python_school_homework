    <p>Dear Chris,</p>
    <p>I hope you are doing well. I have some questions for class four.</p>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Should I upload all the files for worksheet_4 or only jupyter file?
        </li>
        <li>
          I found out Matplotlib can only produce static graphics. Is there any
          interactive graph python library where users can hover and click the
          graph or make the animation?
        </li>
        <li>
          I am still not sure when "os" is necessary. Ex, I don't need os to
          create new files, but why do I need to use os.makedirs to create
          another folder?<br />
          <div>
             <code>
            with open(f"Output/ReadyToSend/letter_{stripped_name}.txt", "a") as ready_to_sent:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ready_to_sent.write(new_content) <br>
os.makedirs(currentpath + '/test_2')
          </code>
        </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          If I want to understand the f<span
            >oundations of computer science, are there any</span
          >
          comprehensive resources to understand the deeper cs principles? Like
          courses, videos or websites (<em>except for books....please</em>).
          Information from the internet is a bit overwhelming, and books are too
          hardcore for me.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Best regards,&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Wen</p>
